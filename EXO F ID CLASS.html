        <p id="nezarec">Nezarec, Final God of Pain was a Disciple of the Witness. An ancient being with powerful psychic abilities, he was known for bringing terror to entire worlds and species in order to feed on their collective fear; he was both feared and worshipped by various groups across time, including cults and sects among the pre-Cabal Psions and pre-Golden Age Humanity. </p>
        
        <p id="rhulk">Rhulk, Disciple of the Witness is the first of the Witness's chosen Disciples, extraordinarily powerful paracausal wielders of the Darkness and the strongest known generals of the Black Fleet. Hailing from the planet Lubrae, he played a prominent role in the creation of the Hive by subjugating the Worm mother, Xita, into servitude and propagate her larvae that all Hive would have as their parasitic fodder. For his part as the titular Subjugator that the Worms revered, he would cultivate their breeding for the Hive's armies in Savath√ªn's Throne World, all while keeping tabs on the Witch Queen herself from his own Pyramid. </p>
       
        <p id="calus">Emperor Calus is the former Emperor of the Cabal. After overthrowing the ruling Praetorate, he reigned the Cabal Empire for over a thousand years until he was overthrown himself in a coup led by Dominus Ghaul and exiled to aimlessly wander the galaxy aboard the Leviathan. It was there he first encountered the Witness who enabled him to take control of his fate. </p>
