        <p>
          he raid begins in the Hall of Souls, where the fireteam is required to
          open the portal in the Court of Oryx by activating the six statues in
          sequence. Two relics will appear in the area, on columns immediately
          outside the court. When two Guardians take these relics, the area
          containing the statues will be blocked off by a force field and Taken
          will spawn within it. The remaining four players must shoot the field
          until it falls, then kill the enemies, allowing the relic holders to
          deposit both relics in quick succession into the marked statue. Once
          this has been done, two more relics will spawn elsewhere in the level,
          one to the right of the pre-Court room and one to the left, and must
          be retrieved and deposited in the same order. This process must be
          repeated six times, each time with the relics appearing further and
          further away and with more enemies and force fields between them and
          the statues. If the relics are not retrieved and deposited fast
          enough, the statue will depower and the sequence will regress by one
          stage.
